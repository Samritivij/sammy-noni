            <p>Whole species are being hunted to extinction, as part of an illegal trade that benefits organised criminal gangs. The illegal wildlife trade is valued between $50-150 billion USD per year and is one of the five most lucrative global crimes. Illegal killing and trading of wild animals is a global crisis, with species being hunted to extinction for their horns, skins and teeth.</p>
            <p>United for Wildlife works to tackle illegal wildlife trade by bringing together conservation organisations, governments, and global corporations. Led by The Duke of Cambridge and The Royal Foundation, United for Wildlife is working to protect endangered species like elephants, rhinos, tigers and pangolins so they can share our world with future generations.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><em>We promise to do everything in our power to continue offering the best protection for all animals – the stray cats and dogs, livestock such as donkeys, cattle, sheep and goats as well as wildlife like pangolins and sloths, elephants and bears. Please support our work </em></p>

            <p><strong><em>Together we can:</em></strong></p>
            <p><em>1. Support new and innovative ways to protect animals against poachers.</em></p>
            <p><em>2. Combine forces to crack down on trafficking.</em></p>
            <p><em>3. Change global mindsets and reduce demand.</em></p>

            <p><strong><em>Our History</em></strong></p>
            <p><em>Founded in 2020, LIFE MATTERS.COM Foundation of India already has improved the lives of multiple stray animals. We are shelter based rescue in Hyderabad city, India. Our grantees are Breath Animal Foster home – Hyderabad, India, Catty Tales – Mumbai, Guardians of Angels Trust – Haryana, Love for Animals Lord Budda Foundation – New Delhi, ALAI Rescues – Bangalore and numerous foster families. Working for Animals, Australia are our partners. Our volunteers bring into action; when we receive a report of a stray animal, our volunteers catch it and bring it to one of our shelter. Our shelter and foster staff then arrange for necessary veterinary and animal birth control procedures. Once recovered, they are released back where found or place them up for adoption.</em></p>

            <p><em>We’re working to get care, food and shelter for the stray animals of Hyderabad, India. Dozens of animals of all kinds given the care they need to survive. But we’re not done. The streets of Hyderabad in India are a rough place for stray animals, forced to fend for themselves against food scarcity, abuse, and temperatures up to 115 degrees. When I first saw the plight of these poor creatures, I knew I had to help. We formed our foundation to provide rescue crews, food, medical care, and training to give a brand new life to neglected dogs, cats, livestock and more. We’re thinking even bigger. </em></p>

            <p><strong><em>Our Future</em></strong></p>
            
            <p><em>Unfortunately, the adoption rate for stray animals in India is nearly zero. With your assistance, we can change that.</em></p>

            <p><em>Our long-term plans include doubling the number of animal birth control procedures, expand our foster, veterinary and shelter networks, and renovate our shelter in Hyderabad to be efficient, complete with a fully staffed animal ambulance to catch and begin the chain of care for stray animals. Donate now to help us take the work forward.</em></p>
            
            <p><em>Indian street dogs struggle for food and shelter, get run over by automobiles, and are victims of accidental and intentional human cruelty. In turn, they pose threats to human safety and aesthetics, with rabies, mauling and dog feces being just a few examples. But ownerless dogs are allowed to live, nonetheless, as ‘street dogs’, rather than being killed as ‘stray dogs’.</em></p>

            <p><em>Studies indicates that there are gaps in the knowledge and attitudes of individuals living in urban slums regarding animal handling, rabies prevention and control. We work to promote awareness targeting at men, older people and uneducated individuals. </em></p>
